# Prompts

In this directory, we present the module prompt used for Section III of the paper.  Using these prompts in GPT-4 enables it to generate programs with these characteristics for processor verification.

Please note that the prompts in this directory constitute only a part of the entire conversation flow in this paper.   Using these prompts directly may be challenging in generating programs that are compatible with the corresponding processor.   Additionally, it is essential to consider the preceding rule-based prompt and the subsequent LLM-assisted test case optimization.   For a detailed workflow, please refer to the paper.

The folder names in this directory correspond to the six modules verified in the paper, and each module folder corresponds to prompts of different program characteristics.
