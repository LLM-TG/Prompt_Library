Overflow and Underflow: Construct tests that intentionally trigger overflow and underflow in arithmetic operations. For example, add two large positive numbers that exceed the maximum 64-bit integer value to test overflow, and subtract a large number from a small one to test underflow. Verify that the processor handles these scenarios as expected.
