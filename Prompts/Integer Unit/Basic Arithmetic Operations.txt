Basic Arithmetic Operations: Develop programs that execute basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on 64-bit integers. For each operation, include a variety of test cases, such as operations with zero, positive and negative numbers, and boundary values like the maximum and minimum 64-bit integers. This will help verify the ALU's correctness in handling different scenarios.
