Division Accuracy: Create tests that perform division with varying operand sizes and values, including dividing by zero, one, and negative numbers. Use a mix of dividend and divisor values to check the DIV unit's accuracy and its adherence to the SRT algorithm. Monitor the execution period to ensure it varies appropriately with the operand sizes.
