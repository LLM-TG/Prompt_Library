Memory Access Instructions: Design programs that include a mix of memory access instructions (e.g., load, store) and arithmetic/logic instructions. Test the IDU's ability to decode and schedule memory operations in the presence of other instruction types by evaluating the execution order and the efficiency of memory access in conjunction with other operations.
