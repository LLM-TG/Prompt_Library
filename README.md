# Data Repository for LLM-TG

This repository accompanies the manuscript submitted to ICCD 2024, titled "LLM-TG: Towards Automated Test Case Generation for Processors Using Large Language Models".

It contains the following:

- `Prompts` - this contains the module prompt used for Chapter III in the paper.  These prompts are generated by GPT-4 and possess characteristics that may cover the functionality of verification units.

- `Tests` - this contains the tests generated by 'Prompts' in the data repository.  These are tests generated from `module prompt` by GPT-4 for experimentation.

- `Methodology` - this contains the procedure and data for generating `Tests` and `Prompts` throughout the article, as well as the python script.
