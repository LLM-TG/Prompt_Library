Basic FALU Operations: Develop programs that execute basic floating-point operations (addition, subtraction, comparison) using half-precision, single-precision, and double-precision numbers. Include a variety of test cases, such as operations with zero, positive and negative numbers, and special values like infinity and NaN. This will help verify the FALU's correctness in handling different scenarios and precisions.
