Complex Dependency Chains: Implement programs with long chains of dependent instructions, such as a series of arithmetic operations where each operation depends on the result of the previous one. Test the IDU's ability to handle complex data dependencies and its effectiveness in using register renaming to maintain performance by analyzing the execution order and the latency of the instruction chain.
