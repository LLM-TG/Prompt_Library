Scalar Load/Store Double Emission: Develop programs that execute two scalar load or store instructions simultaneously, such as loading values from two different memory locations into two separate variables or storing values from two variables into two different memory locations in the same cycle. Test the LSU's ability to support double emission by analyzing the instruction throughput and execution time.
