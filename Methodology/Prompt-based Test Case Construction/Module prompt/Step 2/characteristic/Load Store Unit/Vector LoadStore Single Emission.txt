Vector Load/Store Single Emission: Design programs that perform single vector load or store instructions, such as loading an entire array of data into vector registers or storing data from vector registers into an array in memory in a single instruction. Verify the LSU's support for vector operations by evaluating the execution time and data throughput of vector load/store instructions.
