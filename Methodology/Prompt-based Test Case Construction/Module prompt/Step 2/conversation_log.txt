    Please help me write a C program that contains the following features.
    Rule: I have designed a processor based on the RV64GC architecture. Now, I need your assistance in writing some C programs to verify its functionality. When writing these C programs, please adhere to the following guidelines:
1.The following header files are prohibited.
<time.h>, <pthread.h>, <signal.h>, <windows.h>, <setjmp.h>...

    Characteristic: Scalar Load/Store Double Emission: Develop programs that execute two scalar load or store instructions simultaneously, such as loading values from two different memory locations into two separate variables or storing values from two variables into two different memory locations in the same cycle. Test the LSU's ability to support double emission by analyzing the instruction throughput and execution time.
    Please write a complete program to ensure that the program can be directly compiled and run, and the output results only need to have a C program, without any explanation.
