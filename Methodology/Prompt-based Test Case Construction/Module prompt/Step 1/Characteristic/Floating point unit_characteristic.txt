1. ALU Operations: Include test cases for all 64-bit integer operations supported by the ALU, such as addition, subtraction, bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT), and shifts (logical and arithmetic).
2. Basic FALU Operations: Develop programs that execute basic floating-point operations (addition, subtraction, comparison) using half-precision, single-precision, and double-precision numbers. Include a variety of test cases, such as operations with zero, positive and negative numbers, and special values like infinity and NaN. This will help verify the FALU's correctness in handling different scenarios and precisions.
3. Classification Operations: Write programs that classify floating-point numbers, such as checking if a number is NaN, infinity, normal, subnormal, or zero. Test with a range of values to ensure the FALU correctly classifies different types of floating-point numbers.
4. Conversion Operations: Design tests that convert between different floating-point precisions (e.g., half to single, single to double, double to half) and between floating-point and integer types. Include conversions involving boundary values, such as the maximum and minimum representable numbers in each precision, to verify the FALU's conversion accuracy.
5. Exception Handling: Implement programs that trigger floating-point exceptions, such as division by zero, overflow, underflow, and invalid operations. Verify that the FPU correctly handles these exceptions according to the IEEE 754 standard, including setting the appropriate flags and returning the correct result values.
6. FDSU Operations: Implement programs that perform floating-point division and square root operations. Test with different operand values and precisions to verify the FDSU's functionality and precision in handling division and square root calculations.
7. FMAU Operations: Develop tests that perform ordinary multiplication and fused multiply-add (FMA) operations on floating-point numbers. Include a variety of operand combinations and precisions to verify the FMAU's accuracy and efficiency in handling these operations.
8. Mixed FPU Operations: Design programs that combine different floating-point operations, such as addition followed by multiplication or division followed by square root. Include a mix of operand values and precisions to test the FPU's ability to handle complex expressions involving multiple operation types.
9. Precision Testing: Write tests that specifically focus on the precision of floating-point operations. Compare the results of operations with expected values, considering the precision limits of each floating-point format, to verify that the FPU meets the required precision standards.
10. Register Transfer: Implement programs that perform floating-point register transfer operations, such as moving values between different floating-point registers or between floating-point and general-purpose registers. Test with a variety of values, including special values like NaN and infinity, to ensure the FALU handles register transfers correctly.
11.Sign Injection: Create tests that inject a sign bit into a floating-point number, such as changing the sign of a positive number to negative or vice versa. Include cases with zero, normal numbers, and special values like NaN and infinity to verify the FALU's sign injection functionality.
