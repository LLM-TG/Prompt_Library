1. Access Pattern Variation: Create tests with varying access patterns, such as sequential, strided, and random access to memory. Evaluate the LSU's adaptability in handling different data access patterns and its impact on performance by analyzing the data throughput and execution time under different access patterns.
2. Hardware Prefetching: Write programs with predictable access patterns, such as sequential or strided access to arrays, to test the effectiveness of the LSU's 8-channel data stream hardware prefetch technology. Evaluate the impact of prefetching on reducing cache misses and improving data access times.
3. Load/Store Instruction Reordering: Implement programs with a mix of dependent and independent load and store instructions. Observe the LSU's ability to reorder instructions for optimal execution by analyzing the execution order and the impact on performance.
4. Mixed Data Size Access: Design programs that mix load and store instructions with different data sizes in close succession. Test the LSU's ability to handle diverse data sizes efficiently by verifying the correctness of the loaded and stored values for each size.
5. Non-blocking Cache Access: Write programs that perform a series of load and store operations and use cache access patterns to analyze the cache behavior. Verify the LSU's support for non-blocking access to the cache by observing the continuity of instruction execution despite cache misses.
6. Out-of-Order Execution: Implement programs that mix load and store instructions with different dependencies, such as independent load instructions followed by store instructions that depend on the loaded values. Observe the execution order and test the LSU's ability to execute these instructions out of order for improved performance.
7. Parallel Bus Access on Cache Miss: Create tests that intentionally cause cache misses by accessing data not present in the cache. Observe the LSU's ability to access the bus in parallel to fetch the missing data without stalling the execution of other instructions.
8. Pipelined Store/Load Instructions: Implement programs with continuous store or load instructions to verify that the LSU can pipeline these instructions. Test the data throughput by ensuring that the LSU achieves one data access per cycle, as expected.
9. Scalar Load/Store Double Emission: Develop programs that execute two scalar load or store instructions simultaneously, such as loading values from two different memory locations into two separate variables or storing values from two variables into two different memory locations in the same cycle. Test the LSU's ability to support double emission by analyzing the instruction throughput and execution time.
10. Sign and Zero Extension: Design programs that perform load operations for byte and half-word sizes with sign extension and zero extension, respectively. Test the LSU's ability to correctly extend loaded values by comparing the loaded values with the expected results after extension.
11. Support for Various Data Sizes: Create tests that perform load and store operations with different data sizes, including byte, half-word, word, double-word, and four-word. Ensure that the LSU correctly handles various instruction types by verifying the accuracy of loaded and stored values for each data size.
12. Vector Load/Store Single Emission: Design programs that perform single vector load or store instructions, such as loading an entire array of data into vector registers or storing data from vector registers into an array in memory in a single instruction. Verify the LSU's support for vector operations by evaluating the execution time and data throughput of vector load/store instructions.
