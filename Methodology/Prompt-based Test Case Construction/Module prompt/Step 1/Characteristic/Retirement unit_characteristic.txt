1. Arithmetic Instruction Retirement: Create tests that perform a variety of arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to evaluate the RTU's ability to retire arithmetic instructions and deliver correct results.
2. Branch Instruction Retirement: Implement programs with various branch instructions (e.g., conditional branches, loops) to test the RTU's ability to retire branch instructions and maintain correct program flow.
3. Instruction Reordering: Create tests that include sequences of instructions with various dependencies to evaluate the RTU's ability to reorder instructions for efficient retirement. Analyze the retirement order and ensure that it maximizes performance while maintaining program correctness.
4. Memory Access Retirement: Write programs that perform a series of load and store operations to test the RTU's ability to retire memory access instructions. Verify that memory operations are correctly retired and that data consistency is maintained.
5. Mixed Instruction Types Design programs that include a mix of instruction types (e.g., arithmetic, logic, control flow, memory access) to test the RTU's ability to handle diverse instruction retirement scenarios. Analyze the retirement order and execution time to ensure efficient and correct retirement of instructions.
6. Out-of-Order Recovery: Design programs with mixed dependent and independent instructions to test the RTU's ability to recover and retire instructions out of order. Evaluate the execution order and verify that dependent instructions are correctly retired after their dependencies are resolved.
7. Parallel Instruction Retirement: Create programs that execute a series of independent instructions to test the RTU's ability to retire three instructions in parallel per clock cycle. Analyze the instruction throughput and execution time to verify parallel retirement.
8. Precise Exceptions: Write programs that intentionally trigger exceptions (e.g., division by zero, memory access violations) to test the RTU's support for precise exceptions. Verify that the exception is accurately reported and that the state of the processor is correctly maintained for exception handling.
9. Register Stack Management: Design programs that utilize a large number of registers and perform various operations to test the management of the physical register stack. Verify that the register stack correctly allocates and deallocates registers for out-of-order execution and retirement.
10. Result Delivery: Implement programs with instructions that produce results used by subsequent instructions to test the physical register stack's ability to deliver results out of order. Observe the correctness of the results and the order in which they are made available to dependent instructions.
