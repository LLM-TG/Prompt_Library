1. Basic Arithmetic Operations: Develop programs that execute basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on 64-bit integers. For each operation, include a variety of test cases, such as operations with zero, positive and negative numbers, and boundary values like the maximum and minimum 64-bit integers. This will help verify the ALU's correctness in handling different scenarios.
2. Bitwise Operations: Implement programs that perform bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shifts) on 64-bit integers. Test these operations with a variety of inputs, including edge cases like all zeros, all ones, and alternating bit patterns, to ensure the ALU correctly performs bitwise logic.
3. Branch Instructions: Write programs with various branch instructions, such as if-else statements, for-loops, while-loops, and switch-case statements. Include scenarios where branches are taken and not taken to test the BJU's efficiency in handling branch prediction errors. Test with nested branches and loops to assess the BJU's performance in more complex control flow situations.
4. Comparison Operations: Develop tests that use comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=, >=, <=) with 64-bit integers. Include comparisons between equal numbers, different numbers, and boundary cases like the maximum and minimum 64-bit integer values to verify the ALU's comparison capabilities.
5. Division Accuracy: Create tests that perform division with varying operand sizes and values, including dividing by zero, one, and negative numbers. Use a mix of dividend and divisor values to check the DIV unit's accuracy and its adherence to the SRT algorithm. Monitor the execution period to ensure it varies appropriately with the operand sizes.
6. Function Calls with Integer Arguments: Implement functions that take integer arguments and perform various operations, such as arithmetic calculations or bitwise manipulations. Test these functions with different argument values, including boundary cases, to verify the correct handling of function calls, argument passing, and return values in the processor.
7. Immediate Value Operations: Design programs that use immediate values in arithmetic and logic operations, such as adding a constant value to a register or performing bitwise operations with an immediate operand. Test the ALU's ability to correctly handle operations involving immediate values, ensuring that the immediate values are correctly interpreted and used in calculations.
8. Loop Performance: Write loops that perform a large number of iterations with integer operations, such as adding a constant value in each iteration. Test with different loop constructs (for, while, do-while) and varying iteration counts to assess the BJU's efficiency in handling loop branches and its impact on overall performance.
9. Mixed Operations: Create programs that combine different types of operations (arithmetic, bitwise, comparisons) in a single expression or sequence of statements. This tests the ALU's ability to handle complex expressions involving multiple operation types and ensures correct precedence and associativity rules are followed.
10. Multiplication Variants: Design separate programs for testing 16x16, 32x32, and 64x64 integer multiplication. For each variant, provide a range of test cases, including multiplying by zero, one, negative numbers, and the maximum values for each operand size. This ensures that the MULT unit can accurately handle multiplications with different operand sizes.
11. Overflow and Underflow: Construct tests that intentionally trigger overflow and underflow in arithmetic operations. For example, add two large positive numbers that exceed the maximum 64-bit integer value to test overflow, and subtract a large number from a small one to test underflow. Verify that the processor handles these scenarios as expected.
