1. Branch Instruction Decoding: Create tests that include a variety of branch instructions, such as if-else statements, loops, and switch-case statements. Evaluate the IDU's ability to decode and handle control flow instructions by analyzing the accuracy of branch prediction and the handling of branch instructions in the presence of other instruction types.
2. Complex Dependency Chains: Implement programs with long chains of dependent instructions, such as a series of arithmetic operations where each operation depends on the result of the previous one. Test the IDU's ability to handle complex data dependencies and its effectiveness in using register renaming to maintain performance by analyzing the execution order and the latency of the instruction chain.
3. Data Dependency Detection: Design programs with instructions that have data dependencies, such as using the result of an arithmetic operation as the input for a subsequent logic operation. Evaluate the IDU's ability to detect data correlation by observing the execution order and the handling of dependent instructions.
4. Instruction Scheduling: Create tests that include various types of instructions, such as arithmetic operations, logic operations, memory access instructions, and control flow instructions. Evaluate the IDU's out-of-order scheduling capabilities by analyzing the instruction execution order and the efficient utilization of execution units.
5. Memory Access Instructions: Design programs that include a mix of memory access instructions (e.g., load, store) and arithmetic/logic instructions. Test the IDU's ability to decode and schedule memory operations in the presence of other instruction types by evaluating the execution order and the efficiency of memory access in conjunction with other operations.
6. Mix of Independent and Dependent Instructions: Write programs that mix independent instructions with sequences of dependent instructions to test the IDU's ability to decode and schedule instructions for optimal performance. Evaluate the IDU's ability to maximize parallel execution while correctly handling data dependencies.
7. Out-of-Order Execution: Write programs with a mix of independent and dependent instructions, including arithmetic, logic, and control flow instructions. Test the IDU's ability to send instructions out of order to the lower pipeline for execution by evaluating the execution order and the overall performance gains achieved through out-of-order execution.
8. Physical Register Renaming: Implement programs with sequences of instructions that would normally have data dependencies, such as a series of arithmetic operations using the same register. Test the effectiveness of the physical register renaming technique in resolving data dependencies by analyzing the parallel execution of instructions that would otherwise be serialized.
9. Simultaneous Decoding: Develop programs that include sequences of independent instructions, such as a mix of arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction) and logic operations (AND, OR, XOR). Test the IDU's ability to decode three instructions simultaneously by analyzing the instruction throughput and the latency between instruction fetch and execution.
10. Speculative Emission: Design programs with conditional branches and dependent instructions following the branches. Test the IDU's ability to mitigate performance losses through speculative emission by observing the handling of mispredicted branches and the reordering of instructions to maintain high execution efficiency.
