1. Branch Prediction Accuracy: Create programs with branches that are both easy and difficult to predict, such as branches based on random or pseudo-random conditions, or branches with patterns that change over time. Test the overall branch prediction accuracy of the IFU by analyzing the number of correctly predicted branches and the impact on execution time.
2. Direct Branch Prediction: Write programs with a mix of predictable direct branches, such as if-else statements with constant conditions or for-loops with a fixed number of iterations. Assess the accuracy of direct branch prediction by analyzing the execution time and the number of correctly predicted branches.
3. Indirect Branch Prediction: Create tests that include indirect branches, such as function pointers, switch-case statements with variable cases, or virtual function calls in C++. Evaluate the accuracy of indirect branch prediction by monitoring the execution time and the number of correctly predicted branches.
4. Instruction Cache Utilization: Design programs with small loops that execute a set of instructions repeatedly, focusing on accessing the instruction cache efficiently. Vary the size of the instruction set within the loop to test the instruction cache's prediction mechanisms and its ability to reduce access latency.
5. Instruction Prefetch Efficiency: Design programs with different access patterns, such as sequential access, random access, or strided access to instructions. Evaluate the efficiency of instruction prefetching by assessing the impact on execution time and the number of cache misses.
6. Instruction Register Utilization: Implement programs with a variety of instruction types, including arithmetic operations, logic operations, control flow instructions, and memory access instructions. Test the utilization and efficiency of the instruction register by observing the instruction throughput and the latency of different instruction types.
7. Loop Acceleration: Implement programs with tight loops that perform simple arithmetic operations or memory accesses. Test the effectiveness of the loop acceleration register by comparing the execution speed of loops with and without loop acceleration enabled.
8. Mixed Control Flow: Design programs that combine different types of control flow constructs, such as nested loops, if-else statements, switch-case statements, and function calls. Test the IFU's ability to handle complex control flow scenarios by analyzing the execution time and the accuracy of branch predictions.
9. Parallel Instruction Execution: Develop programs that include sequences of independent instructions, such as a series of arithmetic operations on different variables or a mix of arithmetic and logic operations. Test with varying numbers of parallel instructions to assess the IFU's ability to extract and execute multiple instructions simultaneously.
10. Power Consumption: Write programs with varying levels of instruction intensity, such as computation-intensive loops, idle loops, and programs with a mix of active and idle periods. Observe the power consumption characteristics of the IFU under different workload conditions and assess its ability to manage power efficiently.
