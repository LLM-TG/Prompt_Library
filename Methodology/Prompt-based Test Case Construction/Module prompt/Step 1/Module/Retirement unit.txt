The Retirement Unit (RTU) includes a reorder buffer and a physical register file. The reorder buffer is responsible for out-of-order retirement and in-order retirement of instructions, while the physical register file is responsible for out-of-order retirement and forwarding of results. By supporting parallel instruction retirement and fast retirement, the RTU improves instruction retirement efficiency. The RTU retires three instructions in parallel per clock cycle and supports precise exceptions.
