The integer unit includes the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), the Multiplication Unit (MULT), the Division Unit (DIV), and the Branch Jump Unit (BJU). The ALU performs 64-bit integer operations. MULT supports integer multiplication for 16*16, 32*32, and 64*64 operations. The division unit is designed using the SRT algorithm based on radix 16, with the execution cycle varying depending on the operands. The BJU can handle branch misprediction in a single cycle.
