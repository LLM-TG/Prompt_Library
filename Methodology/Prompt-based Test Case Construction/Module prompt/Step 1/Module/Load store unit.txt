The Load/Store Unit (LSU) supports dual issuance of scalar load/store instructions, single issuance of vector load/store instructions, and fully out-of-order execution of all load/store instructions, with non-blocking access to the cache. It supports byte, half-word, word, double-word, and quad-word load/store instructions, and sign and zero extension for byte and half-word load instructions. Load/store instructions can be pipelined, achieving a data throughput of one data access per cycle. It supports an 8-way data stream hardware prefetching technique to prefetch data into the L1 data cache in advance. When there is a miss in the data cache, it supports parallel bus access.
