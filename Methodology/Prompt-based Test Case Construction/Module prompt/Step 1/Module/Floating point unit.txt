The floating-point unit includes the Floating-point Arithmetic Logic Unit (FALU), the Floating-point Fused Multiply-Add Unit (FMAU), and the Floating-point Division Square Root Unit (FDSU), supporting half-precision, single-precision, and double-precision operations. The FALU is responsible for addition, subtraction, comparison, conversion, register transfer, sign injection, classification, and other operations. The FMAU handles ordinary multiplication, fused multiply-add operations, and others. The FDSU is responsible for floating-point division, square root, and other operations.
