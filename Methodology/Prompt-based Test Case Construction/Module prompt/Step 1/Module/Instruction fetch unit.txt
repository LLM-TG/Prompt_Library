Instruction Fetch Unit (IFU) can fetch up to eight instructions at a time and process them in parallel. It incorporates several technologies to improve access efficiency, such as instruction high-path prediction, instruction cache, loop acceleration cache, direct/indirect branch prediction, etc. The entire Instruction Fetch Unit is characterized by low power consumption, high branch prediction accuracy, and high instruction prefetch efficiency.
