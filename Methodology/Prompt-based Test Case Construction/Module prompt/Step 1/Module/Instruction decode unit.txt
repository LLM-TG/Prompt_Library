The Instruction Decode Unit (IDU) can simultaneously decode three instructions and detect data dependencies. It uses physical register renaming technology to resolve data dependencies between instructions and sends instructions out of order for execution in the next pipeline stage. The Instruction Decode Unit supports out-of-order scheduling and dispatch of instructions and mitigates performance losses caused by data dependencies through speculative execution.
