I have designed a processor based on the RV64GC architecture. Now, I need your assistance in writing some C programs to verify its functionality. When writing these C programs, please adhere to the following guidelines:
1.The following header files are prohibited.
<time.h>, <pthread.h>, <signal.h>, <windows.h>, <setjmp.h>...
2.The following C language functions are prohibited.
rand(), malloc(), scanf(), fopen(),  system()...
3.{Forbidden Inline Assembly Instructions}
ecall, ebreak, mret, wfi, sret, c.ebreak...
